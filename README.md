# StatPilot

This is my final project for CS50x course. It's an interactive web application for statistical data analysis, machine learning modeling, and model explainability — built with Flask and Python.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Upload a CSV and get automatic descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights.
- 🧠 **Modeling**: Train ML models (e.g. regression, classification) directly from your browser.
- 💡 **Explainability**: Understand your model decisions with techniques like feature importance and SHAP values.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python, Flask
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Wordcloud
- Jinja2 for templating
- HTML/CSS/JS for frontend

## 🌐 Try it Online

👉 **Access the app here**: [coming-soon](coming soon)

No installation required — just open the app and start exploring your data.

## 📥 Usage

1. Navigate to the **"Data Analysis"** section to upload your dataset (CSV format) to view automatic summaries, statistics, and visualizations.
2. Use the **"Machine Learning"** tab to train a machine learning model on your data.
3. Go to **"Explainable AI"** to interpret model decisions with visual tools.

## 📌 Notes

- Your data is not stored or shared.
- Categorical, numerical, and textual data are automatically detected and analyzed accordingly.
- Ensure your data are clean and correctly decoded to help the tool doing proper analysis.
- At the moment the app does not support time series analysis and all datetime columns are dropped. Coming soon!
